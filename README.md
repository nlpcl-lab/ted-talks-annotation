### Pre-requisites

1. Install and run [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### Setup 

1. To connect the Mongodb, make your own config.py: `cp config.smaple.py config.py`
    - If the default setting of the Mongodb has not been changed, you don't need to modify the config.py
    
2. Install python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Download TED talks videos on the data/video_list: `python downloader.py`
